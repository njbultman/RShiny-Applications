# Stock-Station
This R Shiny application is focused around stock visualization and strategy selection. For visualization, we leverage the `plotly` package and for strategy selection we mainly use the `quantstrat` package. I highly encourage you to look more into the documentation for both of these if you are interested in learning more!
